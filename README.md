# 🚀 My DSA Journey

Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) journey repository! This is my personal collection of solved problems, notes, and approaches, and I’m excited to share my progress and learnings with you all. Join me as I work through DSA topics, refine problem-solving skills, and prepare for competitive programming challenges.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository organizes DSA problems by category with clear hierarchy and labels:

- **📂 Arrays**
  - 📝 **Array_Sum.md** - Sum elements in an array
  - 📝 **Max_Subarray.md** - Kadane's Algorithm for max subarray sum
  - 📝 **Merge_Sorted_Arrays.md** - Merge two sorted arrays
  
- **📂 Linked Lists**
  - 📝 **Reverse_Linked_List.md** - Reverse a linked list
  - 📝 **Detect_Cycle.md** - Cycle detection in linked list
  
- **📂 Trees**
  - 📝 **Binary_Tree_Inorder.md** - Binary tree inorder traversal
  - 📝 **Lowest_Common_Ancestor.md** - Find lowest common ancestor
